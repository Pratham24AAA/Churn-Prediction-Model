# Churn-Prediction-Model
"Churn" refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers stop using a service or product. In the context of businesses, 
especially those offering subscription-based services like telecommunications, software as a service (SaaS), or streaming platforms,
churn represents the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription or stop using the service altogether.

Developed a predictive model to anticipate whether a specific customer is inclined to discontinue their telecommunication services, 
providing valuable insights to the company. This enables the company to prioritize efforts towards retaining existing customers, 
recognizing their significance alongside acquiring new ones for overall company improvement.
